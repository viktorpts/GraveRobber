# Sprite sheet indexing file. Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored while parsing.
# The frame at index 0 will be the default frame, if the requested sequence or frame was not found.
# Parameters MUST be defined in the following order: image, frame/s, sequence; the rest is optional.
# 
# Parameters:
#
# name - name that will be used to refer to this animation
# image - source spritesheet filename (starting directory is /resources)
# framerate - animation speed in frames per second
# frame - single frame coordinates
#   0=left
#   1=top
#   2=width
#   3=height
#   4=left offset
#   5=top offset
#
# frames - array of frames
#   0=left
#   1=top
#   2=width
#   3=height
#   4=left offset
#   5=top offset
#   6=rows
#   7=columns
#
# sequence - named sequence
#   0=name
#   1=starting direction (inclusive)(radians)
#   2=ending direction (exclusive)(radians)
#   3...=frame indexes (starting at zero)
